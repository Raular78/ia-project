# Project Title
Hotel Bot Assistant
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This is a project to answer frequently asked questions from hotel users and help reception staff optimize their work time, it can answer questions related to the hotel and the area where it is located, offering excursions, services, etc.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1: help reception staff and the hotel in general to optimize their working time, by not having to answer repetitive questions from customers
* problem 2: Can help increase sales of excursions or products in the area.
* problem 3: Organize dining hours and events, with an extension you can integrate a reservation system


## How is it used?

the use process would be through a graphical and simple application, customized for each client if necessary, a supervised learning process is used for AI training, in which the widest possible range of frequently asked questions is delivered, including meaningless questions, and the correct answers to those questions.

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
